	 style="font-weight: normal;">SpigitEngage API Terms</span></b></h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Updated: April 2015</p>
<p>These SpigitEngage API Terms (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>“Agreement”</i></span>) 
 is an agreement between You and Mindjet US Inc. and its affiliates (<span 
	 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>“Mindjet”</i></span>) and 
 applies to the SpigitEngage API and its documentation (the <span style="font-weight: bold; 
	 font-style: italic;"><i>“API”</i></span>). The terms also apply to any Mindjet 
 updates for the API, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, 
 those terms apply.</p>
<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING WITH MINDJET, BY DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING 
 OR USING THE API YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
 &quot;YOU&quot; MEANS THE NATURAL PERSON OR THE ENTITY THAT IS AGREEING 
 TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. YOU SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE TO 
 COMPLY WITH THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU COMPLY WITH THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE 
 THE RIGHTS BELOW.</p>
<p>Mindjet reserves the right to modify, add to, change, or remove (<span 
	 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>“Modification(s)”</i></span>) 
 any part of this</p>
<p>Agreement at any time, and such Modification(s) will become effective 
 upon notice to You. Mindjet will notify You by posting notice of the Modification(s) 
 on Mindjet’s website, and/or by notifying You by email at the email address 
 provided by You, if any, and You consent to Mindjet sending such notifications 
 of Modification(s) to this Agreement by posting notice on Mindjet’s website 
 or delivery to your email address. Except as outlined above, all Modifications 
 to this Agreement will be effective when posted (or after a notice is 
 sent to your email address), and your continued use of the API after the 
 sending of such notice will constitute your acceptance of, and your agreement 
 to be bound by, those Modification(s). If You do not agree to (or cannot 
 comply with) this Agreement as amended, your sole remedy is to stop using 
 the API.</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">API</span>. 
	 The API consists of interface definitions and associated tools and 
	 documentation that allow you to create software application(s) or 
	 website(s) (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>“Application(s)”</i></span>) 
	 which will display SpigitEngage content and materials (<span style="font-weight: bold; 
	 font-style: italic;"><i>“Content”</i></span>), subject to the limitations 
	 and conditions described below or any other data or information that 
	 Mindjet may provide or otherwise make available from time to time. 
	 For avoidance of doubt, nothing herein obligates Mindjet to make any 
	 API available to you and you agree and acknowledge that any access 
	 to items provided above is within the sole and absolute direction 
	 of Mindjet. The API is available in the English language only. License 
	 to the SpigitEngage Solution is subject to a separate agreement with 
	 its own licensing restrictions.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">License 
	 Grant</span>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
	 Mindjet grants to You a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable 
	 license to access and use the API solely to develop, test, display, 
	 distribute and execute your Application, to access and display Content 
	 in your Application; and to allow others to access your Application. 
	 You will not, and will not permit any person directly or indirectly, 
	 to (i) reverse engineer, disassemble, reconstruct, decompile, translate, 
	 modify, copy or, other than as explicitly permitted hereunder (except 
	 to the extent the foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by 
	 applicable law notwithstanding this limitation), or (ii) create derivative 
	 works of the API, or any aspect or portion thereof, including without 
	 limitation, source code and algorithms. You shall not distribute or 
	 otherwise disseminate the API by any means or in any form, except 
	 as an integral part of your Application.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modifications</span>. 
	 Mindjet reserves the right to release subsequent versions of the API 
	 and to require you to obtain and use the most recent version. The 
	 API is currently provided for free, and while Mindjet has no plans 
	 to charge You for use, Mindjet does reserve the right to charge for 
	 the API in the future.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feedback</span>. 
	 Mindjet may make a designated API feedback forum (<span style="font-weight: bold; 
															 font-style: italic;"><i>“Feedback 
	 Forum”</i></span>) and may make it available through a third party provider. 
	 If You wish to provide your feedback (<span style="font-weight: bold; 
												 font-style: italic;"><i>“Feedback”</i></span>) 
	 on the Feedback Forum, you must accept the terms and conditions applicable 
	 to the Feedback Forum, including any third party provider terms and 
	 conditions. Your failure to accept the terms of those agreements may 
	 limit your ability to fully use the Feedback Forum. Additionally, 
	 you represent and warrant that: (a) you own or have sufficient rights 
	 to make available the Feedback; and (b) the posting of your Feedback 
	 does not violate any privacy rights, publicity rights, contract rights, 
	 intellectual property rights, or any other rights, of any person or 
	 entity. You agree your Feedback will be deemed Mindjet Confidential 
	 (as defined below), but will not be deemed confidential to You. Any 
	 intellectual property ownership notices contained in any Feedback 
	 shall be without effect. You grant Mindjet an unrestricted, irrevocable 
	 license to display, use, modify, perform, reproduce, transmit, and 
	 distribute any feedback you post on the Feedback Forum, for any and 
	 all commercial or non-commercial purposes. You agree Mindjet is free 
	 to use any Feedback for any purpose, including, but not limited to, 
	 developing, manufacturing, and marketing products that incorporate 
	 such Feedback. THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MINDJET 
	 HEREBY DISCLAIMS WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND IN THE FEEDBACK FORUM, WHETHER 
	 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED 
	 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, 
	 QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 
	 IN NO EVENT SHALL MINJDET BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
	 INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY ALLEGED LOSS OF PROFITS 
	 OR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF DATA, ARISING 
	 OUT OF USE OF THE FEEDBACK FORUM.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intellectual 
	 Property</span>. Mindjet retains ownership of all its right, title 
	 and interest, including without limitation all copyrights, patent, 
	 trademark, and other intellectual property rights in the API and any 
	 and all elements and components, pre-release materials (including 
	 any pre-release versions of the API), and any copies or portions thereof. 
	 Except as expressly set forth herein, no other rights or licenses 
	 are granted or implied, and Mindjet reserves all rights not expressly 
	 granted to you. Unless expressly permitted herein or otherwise in 
	 a separate agreement with Mindjet, you may not modify, publish, network, 
	 rent, lease, loan, translate, transmit, sell, sublicense, assign, 
	 participate in the sale or the transfer of any rights therein, reproduce, 
	 create derivative works based on or any part thereof, redistribute, 
	 perform, display, or in any way exploit the API in whole or in part. 
	 Except as permitted by law, you agree not to, or cause another to, 
	 reverse engineer, reverse compile (including reverse compiling to 
	 ensure interoperability), or disassemble any components of the API, 
	 or otherwise attempt to discern the source code of any components 
	 of the API.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidentiality</span>. 
	 <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>“Mindjet Confidential 
	 Information”</i></span> means non-public information of a confidential 
	 nature disclosed by pursuant to this Agreement, irrespective of the 
	 medium or form in which such information is disclosed. Mindjet Confidential 
	 Information may include, but is not limited to any components of the 
	 API, including its security features, pre-release materials, and any 
	 Feedback You provide to Mindjet. Mindjet Confidential Information 
	 does not include information: (a) already known by you, without restriction, 
	 at the time of disclosure by Mindjet, as demonstrated by written records 
	 in existence at the time of disclosure; (b) known to you from a third 
	 party lawfully in possession thereof without breach of this obligation 
	 of confidentiality, or any other third party obligation of confidentiality 
	 or restrictions with respect to such information; (c) in the public 
	 domain at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes a part of 
	 the public domain through no fault of you; (d) independently ascertained 
	 or developed by or for you without use of or reference to any Mindjet 
	 Confidential Information, as demonstrated by written records (excluding 
	 your Feedback); or (e) approved for public release by written authorization 
	 of Mindjet. Unless otherwise expressly agreed or permitted in writing 
	 by Mindjet, you agree not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any 
	 Mindjet Confidential Information to third parties, or use Mindjet 
	 Confidential Information for any reasons other than using the API 
	 in accordance with this Agreement. You further agree to take reasonable 
	 precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, 
	 or dissemination of Mindjet Confidential Information, no less protective 
	 than how You treat your own confidential information. You acknowledge 
	 unauthorized disclosure or use of Mindjet Confidential Information 
	 could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Mindjet that 
	 may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, you agree Mindjet will 
	 have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to enforce your 
	 obligations under this Agreement in addition to any other rights and 
	 remedies it may have. If you are required by law, regulation or pursuant 
	 to the valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to 
	 disclose Mindjet Confidential Information, you may make such disclosure, 
	 but only after you promptly notify Mindjet before making such disclosure 
	 to allow Mindjet to seek confidential, protective treatment of such 
	 information, and use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the 
	 disclosure or furnish that portion of such Mindjet Confidential Information 
	 which is legally required. A disclosure pursuant to the previous sentence 
	 will not relieve you of your obligations to otherwise hold such information 
	 as Mindjet Confidential Information.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fees</span>. 
	 The API is currently provided without charge, but Mindjet reserves 
	 the right to charge for access in the future.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Term 
	 and Termination</span>. Mindjet may terminate your license to the 
	 API in its absolute discretion at any time, without notice, and for 
	 any reason including, without limitation: (a) violation of this Agreement; 
	 (b) your written request for such termination at any time for any 
	 reason; or (c) as required by law, regulation, court or governing 
	 agency order. Upon termination, you must immediately cease use of 
	 the API and you agree to destroy and/or certify destruction of, any 
	 Mindjet Confidential Information and the API in your possession or 
	 control. Mindjet shall not be liable to you or any third party for 
	 any termination of your license. Sections IV (Feedback), V (Intellectual 
	 Property), VI (Mindjet Confidential Information), VIII (Term and Termination), 
	 IX (Trademarks), X (No Warranty), XII (Limitation on Liability), XII 
	 (Indemnification), and XIII (Miscellaneous) shall survive termination 
	 of this Agreement.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trademarks</span>. 
	 Mindjet, the ‘M’ design logo, MindManager, Spigit, SpigitEngage, and 
	 other Mindjet trademarks, or product or service names, are Mindjet 
	 trademarks or registered trademarks in the United States and in other 
	 countries (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i>“Mindjet 
	 Marks”</i></span>). You may display or use Mindjet Marks only in accordance 
	 with the Mindjet Trademark Policy and the Mindjet Corporate Branding 
	 Guidelines posted on http://www.mindjet.com/legal. You agree that 
	 all goodwill arising out of your authorized use of Mindjet Marks shall 
	 inure to the benefit of and belong to Mindjet. You may not remove 
	 any existing copyrights, notices, or disclaimers in accessing the 
	 API.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO 
	 WARRANTY</span>. THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MINDJET 
	 AND ITS LICENSORS PROVIDE THE API WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, 
	 WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR IN ANY OTHER PROVISION OF 
	 THIS AGREEMENT, OR COMMUNICATION WITH YOU INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
	 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
	 PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL 
	 PROPERTY RIGHTS. MINDJET DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE API WILL MEET YOUR 
	 REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE API WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED 
	 OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE API WILL BE CORRECTED. THE API 
	 IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS AND IS SUBJECT 
	 TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. MINDJET DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY RESULTS OR 
	 IDENTIFICATION OR CORRECTION OF PROBLEMS AND MINDJET DISCLAIMS ANY 
	 LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. MINDJET DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY 
	 FOR THE ACTS, OMISSIONS AND CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION 
	 WITH OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE API. YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY 
	 AND ALL RISKS FOR YOUR USE OF THE API. YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST MINDJET 
	 FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE API IS TO STOP USING THE API. THIS LIMITATION 
	 OF RELIEF IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. 
	 MINDJET IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE UPDATES, ENHANCEMENTS, OR 
	 CORRECTIONS, OR AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU RECEIVE PURUSANT TO 
	 THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO NOTIFY YOU OF, ANY CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, 
	 OR TO PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE OR INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">LIMITATION 
	 OF LIABILITY</span>. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
	 LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MINJDET BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
	 SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY ALLEGED 
	 LOSS OF PROFITS OR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR 
	 LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER ARISING UNDER TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE OR 
	 WHETHER OR NOT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES HAS BEEN DISCLOSED 
	 IN ADVANCE OR COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLE FORESEEN. To the maximum 
	 extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and waive all 
	 claims against Mindjet from any and all liability for claims, damages 
	 (actual and/or consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation 
	 costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising from 
	 or in any way related to your use of the API. You understand that 
	 any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found 
	 to be other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume 
	 the risk of such possible differences in fact. In addition, you expressly 
	 waive and relinquish any and all rights and benefits which you may 
	 have under any other state or federal statute or common law principle 
	 of similar effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law. If you 
	 are a California resident, you waive your rights under California 
	 Civil Code Section 1542 which states: &quot; A general release does 
	 not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to 
	 exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which 
	 if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement 
	 with the debtor.&quot;</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; 
											 margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Indemnification</span>: 
	 You agree to indemnify and hold Mindjet harmless from any claim or 
	 demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party 
	 due to or arising out of (a) any Content, including Applications, 
	 Content within Applications, and websites, that you develop or make 
	 available from the API, (b) your use of the API for any purpose in 
	 breach of this Agreement, (c) your violation of this Agreement, or 
	 (d) your violation of any rights of any third party.</p></li>
	<li style="list-style: upper-roman;"><p style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0pt; 
											 margin-bottom: 4.5pt;"><span 
	 style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous</span></p></li>
	<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0pt;"><span 
		 style="font-weight: bold;">Export Control</span>. You represent 
		 You are not a person on a list barring You from receiving services 
		 or products under United States laws or other applicable jurisdiction, 
		 including without limitations, the Denied Persons List and the 
		 Entity List, and other lists issued by the United States Department 
		 of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, detailed at http://www.bis.doc.gov/complianceandenforcement/ListsToCheck.htm 
		 (or successor sites thereto). You may not use or otherwise export 
		 or re-export the API except as authorized by United States law 
		 and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the API was obtained. 
		 In particular, but without limitation, the API may not be exported 
		 or re-exported (a) into any United States embargoed countries 
		 or (b) to anyone on the United States Treasury Department's list 
		 of Specially Designated Nationals or the United States Department 
		 of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List. You agree you 
		 will not use API for any purposes prohibited by United States 
		 law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture 
		 or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Governing 
		 Law; Venue</span>. This Agreement will be governed by and construed 
		 in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding 
		 its conflict of law provisions. The parties further submit to 
		 and waive any objections to personal jurisdiction of and venue 
		 in San Francisco County, for any disputes arising out of this 
		 Agreement. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations 
		 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the 
		 application of which is expressly excluded.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationship 
		 with Mindjet</span>. You understand and agree that under this 
		 Agreement you and Mindjet shall be and act independently and not 
		 as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee, or employer of the 
		 other. You shall not have any authority to assume or create any 
		 obligation for or on behalf of Mindjet, express or implied, and 
		 you shall not attempt to bind Mindjet to any contract.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Waiver</span>. 
		 No delay or failure to take action under this Agreement will constitute 
		 a waiver unless expressly waived in writing, signed by a duly 
		 authorized representative of Mindjet, and no single waiver will 
		 constitute a continuing or subsequent waiver.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assignment</span>. 
		 This Agreement will bind your successors but may not be assigned, 
		 in whole or part, by you without the written approval of an authorized 
		 representative of Mindjet.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Severability</span>. 
		 Any nonconforming assignment shall be null and void. If any provision 
		 is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall 
		 be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so the 
		 Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and 
		 enforceable.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Entire 
		 Agreement</span>. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement 
		 between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes 
		 all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject 
		 matter. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement 
		 above, no addition to or removal or modification of any of the 
		 Agreement will be binding upon Mindjet unless made in writing 
		 and signed by an authorized representative of Mindjet. The parties 
		 confirm they have requested the Agreement and any documents incorporated 
		 by reference to be drafted in English.</p></li>
